Comment: 
Lady Gaga's New Beau Lady Gaga is all over the news once again, and this time it is, for her not so "born this way" new beau, Taylor Kinney. The New Yorkborn creative diva was seen walking with her 30 year old actormodel boy friend near his rundown beach condo, located north of San Diego. Kinney shares the place with his three friends. The singer, whose real name is Stefani Germanotta, was earlier involved with a handsome nightclub Manager from Springfield, Nebraska, Luc Carl. Both were together since 2005, and Carl was of the view that a lot of Gaga's success is engineered by him and his personal training of the artist. Carl is also a promoter, musician, DJ, author and bartender, known for his love for leather boots and handsome looks. Both had some disagreements over simple and complex career matters and Gaga stopped seeing him in 2010, when her career took off. The multimillionaire Lady Gaga likes staying at Taylor Kinney's place more than any five star hotels that she can well afford. Both got close together after Gaga's "You and I" which also featured Kinney. Taylor is also popular for his role in the "Vampire Diaries" as Mason Lockwood, and has his own community of fans. Lady Gaga is also looking for a home in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, where both have been seen together several times. Gaga and Kinney love each other's company and now spend a lot of time together. They are going out to the local bars and restaurants, and even grocery shopping together in Lititz. There are many rumors on the net claiming that Lady Gaga has already purchased a home in the area. WHP TV, a local news station, says Gaga was reportedly looking at the Oak Hill Road home, a 6000square foot mansion priced at $1.7 million. The mansion is safely situated within the gated community of Bent Creek in Manheim Township. Lady Gaga is a 25 year old idol, known for creative dressing, who has proven herself a genius while fighting for the LGBT rights and winning over young hearts with the "Born this way" movement. She has been shocking the world with crazy dresses, and doing funny and shocking acts like coming out dressed as a man for the awards, and doing outrageous comedy. Many real estate agents are looking forward to helping the couple buy real estate in Pennsylvania, while others believe its all rumors.
