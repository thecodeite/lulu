Top 3 Tips From an Expert Tattoo Artist If you are looking for custom tattoo designs, a good tattoo artist would advise you to exert yourself and make an effort to do some research. With traditional styles and designs available in catalogs and online galleries, you might find that the design you like is not as unique as you think. Tattoos serve as an extension of your character and can make you look good, so it is right to choose a design that is trendy, appealing and more importantly, shows the real you. With tattoos, you will want to avoid any mistakes. Cover ups are a messy option and removal is expensive and difficult; neither sounds appealing. To avoid this from happening, here are some tips from an expert tattoo artist that you might want to consider. Tattoos are for the Skin Remember your body provides the canvas for the drawing, so what may look good on paper would not necessarily be good on you. Consider your skin color when opting for a tattoo design with a color. The color should match the color and texture of your skin. Try to print or draw the design onto paper that as far as possible, matches your skin color. This way, you may get an idea of what should be and what should not. If your design has a lot of intricate detail, try a color that will bring out the details of your design, otherwise you will end up with a tattoo where everyone will end up wondering what it is all about. The Part of the Body to be Inked Just because you have the perfect design, it doesn't mean that you can get it etched anywhere on your body. Some tattoos are only meant for certain places, like your back, legs, wrist, shoulder or even your heel. A good tattoo artist knows how to take advantage of body curves to highlight every intricate detail of a tattoo design. Also, some people, although they wear tattoos, do not want it placed on exposed parts of the body because of professional and ethical reasons. A tattoo artist can provide you with some suggestions of where to put these designs that would not cause you any trouble. Tattoos are artwork, and are not meant to be vulgar. The Price Tattoos vary in cost depending on the size, complexity of the design or where the tattoo will be placed. Custom tattoo designs are more expensive than traditional ones, since they are oneofakind. One way to have a more affordable personalized design is by hosting your own custom tattoo design contest. Find sites on the internet that provide a platform for this contest. All you need to do is to sign up, provide details of the design you require, set up a prize, and choose from among the designers who you think provided you with the best custom tattoo design based on your preferences. This contest will provide you with a series of designs to choose from and give you the opportunity to find a perfect tattoo designer from anywhere in the world. To conclude, tattoos are part of your body, so it is proper that you take care of them. A good tattoo artist provides aftercare advice for your tattoo. That includes using antibacterial soaps and moisturizers. Aftercare is important to make your tattoo last your whole lifetime, always looking brand new, attractive and not faded. After all, it is part of who you are as a person, and not just an accessory.
